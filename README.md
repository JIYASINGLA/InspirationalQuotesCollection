**Inspirational Quotes – Positive Word Frequency Analysis**

This project is about finding which positive words appear the most in a large set of inspirational quotes. I collected around 1000–2000 quotes and analyzed the text to see which motivational themes are used repeatedly (like hope, dream, courage, success, etc.).

I mainly built this project to practice text handling, cleaning, and basic NLP tasks.

**Why I Did This Project**

I wanted to explore:

how to work with a large text file

how to clean and preprocess text data

how to count how many times specific words appear

how to visualize results clearly

It helped me understand how real text data behaves and how to extract useful patterns from it.

**Dataset**

All the quotes are stored in a single text file named:

inspirational_quotes.txt


The text file contains multiple quotes, one per line or separated by newline breaks.

What the Project Does
✔ Cleans the Text

Converts everything to lowercase

Removes punctuation

Removes extra spaces

✔ Selects Positive Words

Some of the words I focused on:

success, dream, believe, hope, courage, life, work, goal, future, inspire

✔ Counts Word Frequency

It checks how many times each selected positive word appears across all quotes.

**✔ Generates Output**

A CSV file showing each word and its frequency

A bar graph comparing word counts

A word cloud highlighting the most common positive words

These outputs make it easy to understand which themes appear the most in inspirational writing.

**What I Learned**

This project helped me understand:

how to clean unstructured text

how to work with word frequency counts

how to create visualizations

how to structure a simple text-analysis project

Overall, it was a great hands-on exercise to practice Python and basic NLP concepts.

**Future Ideas**

Some improvements I might add later:

expanding the list of positive words

running sentiment analysis on each quote

grouping quotes by themes

building a small interface to view results interactively
